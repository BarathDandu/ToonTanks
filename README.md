# ToonTanks

ToonTanks is a Tank Game where the player has to fight enemy AI tanks to win, if the player fails to eliminate all tanks before dying they lose.

The AI and the player controller use the same mechanism but the AI Tanks are limited to 1 shot every 2 seconds. 

The Zipfile required to open the entire project is also uploaded
